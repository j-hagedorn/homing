Outward form or appearance; guise. 2. spec. The dress of a religious order; the habit, the monastic order or profession (cf. ‘the cowl’). 3. concr. The bodily ‘system’. 4. Zool. and Bot. The characteristic mode of growth and general external appearance of an animal or plant. Hence transf.; e.g. in Cryst. the characteristic mode of formation of a crystal. 5. Habitation, abode. 6. A tendency to act in a certain way, acquired by frequent repetition of an act until it becomes almost involuntary. Harbor hidden Harbor hidden in the middle of a turbid current: sperm-tails flailing radiant around a naked solus, ovum beckoning its spent rays in. Each oval head (a match, a latent smoke of info) rubs its cheek against the stony fruit… How does a life expand to meet capacity? I splitting into Ys, diffuse, confused, does one become, at last, a parody of self, diminished twig clung stubborn to the branch’s end? or spread alive at once across its years, a net of nerve to seize the wind in alleluia? Impelled to fill one pattern once we start, the others, never touched, lie fallow with imaginary crops— Two trees grew separate in a garden once, but how to tell the difference now? What life can we conceive except the one we know, crooked with leaving? Myopia, my opus: a cross-eyed squint in radiating focus, half-divining vision. Deus absconditus — draw in the periphery, grant me direct sight, or at least a wending life in which the distances are knit. Even this flimsy string of time should be enough. One matchhead breaks the skin and then, slow flame, the vast potentials end, begin. Another day Another day, the double-dozen heads it dregs aloft again, nodding or shaking; candelabra which some vital wind, obscured behind the quivered stacks of vision, whisper-flicks this way or that, or else some other, as the chance elects. Heavy with self, one glimpses mostly that. What is of use? Enlarge my empire, its flourished thoroughfares, loose runnels clogged sclerotic with expanding self. Fill up these days, this garbage heap of presents only half-received. Abstraction is born on day’s conveyor-belt; repetitive stress yawning out again its regimen of fractal chintz, except that mind’s kaleidoscopic twists craft vistas, infinite, hewn views from changeling oils: beaded, coursed and lit. Each triggerhair of vision has its scope, a shrapnel splash of filings chambered calm before the bang of APPLE, EYE, and RAY: the bullet’s gaze honed down. Any line desires onely Everything; all squall &amp; sprawl of motley time oblonging darkly for a single prize—symmetrically to shut up self in dim dimensioned squint—wanting to shunt bright panoramas into cornices &amp; hold them, ember lit without a lick of motive. Edges once limber end here; end, that is, wherever here is scribed. What’s actual is sketch; de-lineates itself: sight’s scrawl, a ghost of layered percepts. Our eyes want grasp &amp; thus a shape; their lids, euclidean, zodiac the bric-a-brac of bodies, sing—O fit me in, empyrean, among your ferris-wheel of forms—dead center, null hub pronouncing its confines as cause &amp; answer. Here are your parts, O hours, it indicates: a ramshackle Cast extracted from my side: this meadow-choir, Grass-shafts, a bending patch of cilia above/beneath the Hickory’s dendritic click. The mind as silt: black earth, black orrery— Stone sockets pocked at lonely intervals throughout, an interpolated blossom of reflections, foamy-crested Mountains tippling up to Moon, that logical cloud around us curled. Do we impose our visions on the world, or does the world reveal us, gradually, as clustered portions of its patterning? Either way, each solid sight is fraught with yearning, graved in flaming, subtle lineaments. My self &amp; other selves strung out, lined up, articulated like the sentence of a stuttering deity: “…I…I…I…I…,” serrated cry limned into type-cast characters that mar the music by omitting difference. No I is equal to another; each is formed and forms within its singular address, reaches through buoyant cell-skin &amp;, nourished, becomes alive again: volleyed between vacuum &amp; continuum, guessing which is home; gets dizzy on trajectories, alights on breezes, blind to what their vector is. In this same way I bore into the day, its billion limbs &amp; nodes: the host whose face I never wholly glimpse. Buttressed by the vasts Buttressed by the vasts I balance somehow salient The pinnacle &amp; focus of a visive arc Apex’s lonesome aperture grips valleys’ blurry verdure resolute as single snow amid abysm whose frail hub cannot hold up compass of an Other without folding down away Mountains in the mind are movable a billowing sfumato Not actual Not gridlock fluency of prism-rock Out of chaos blossoms Order but out of many orders Chaos (the higher keys &amp; grace-notes) a glissandi bound in shimmer twixt strange strands Lykesongs among the archipelogos The universe’s flesh is holeless entire yet yclepte by our invisions Divine defined in shards Blindly Our rank divisions censered by a scent of sweetnesse as we travel ever in between these temples Heaven sees the self strung from its fingers Gravid plumb hung low to dredge the depths and gauge periphery of grace A catenary dreaming bulk &amp; arc of spiring gesture Praise the strains that made me Blesséd be our scattered minds Islands The shores we pace beside a great &amp; solvent body Oceanic flux of axons ebbing up the lengths ceived round us Peaks in its current pressed one to the next in liquid fissive kiss constrewing sky in tesserae of mercury Your mercy built deep beneath sway of seas fluid Firm a medium obscuring distant sight with tangling task of molecules in colloquy forever Where the whale cathedral-ribbed floats in his own lost songs An entire life returned piecemeal in boreal strands that reel the distances rhythming his body’s hull with thoughts forgot Returning sonorous as longing or or as an unheard prayer bears its gigantic answer hid among the serene &amp; severe expanse it treads without a word Itinerant Itinerant, these threads appear amid the weave this sturdy-seeming life affords; aureal strands intervalled to salience from the drab; a dance not understood by us, but done. Example: Leaves’ eternal shuttling between the branches &amp; the worm; renewed by death into the echelons, they return. Ahistorical, we don’t notice the old currents’ return, new as a day where antique generations weave their hopeful accidents. Nonetheless, we learn to hang together. Cords knit with many strands hold tight, the ancients say and, if we try to leave, entwine their arms in ours, inviting us to dance. Sleuthing truths in books—the worn words dance erratic in my eyes until the scales of sense return to weigh proportions. We forage in quarto leaves hoping for complex fruit among the rhythm’s weave revealed, for lasting names to write upon the strands Elsewhere, where seriphs hold the boundaries &amp; burn. All of our futures have been decided. A heavy burin draws the lines, &amp; yet imbues them with that dance suffusing any partial thing. Fate, unfurling, strands all of us in separate whorls, unable outward to return. Perhaps my life’s isolated thread gleams in the weave. Perhaps it doesn’t. May I unstitch myself &amp; leave? Eventually every lovely thing must leave aside what shapeliness our touchings can discern —raw silk of skin beneath the starry weave— and make its dwindling bed amid the garden’s danse macabre. My threadbare selvage even shall return into new habits, knit from its own unraveled strands. Day by layered day, I spin my crimson trail of strands through citygrid, among the slowly coming leaves. Here, steeped in the concrete, trampled days return excavating me, leaving no scab unturned. We live in our own ruins, labyrinthine dances, entering knots we pray we can unweave. All that we’ve felt is a fray of fumbled strands veering into textured dance. The needle, hiding, leaves ever to sojourn back behind the tapestry, and to return. T To the Chief Singer; On My Stringed Instruments Through fire I choke to raise in song orisons from a burning crux; Through smoke I aspire to sense, up helical stairways, firmer touch. Earth’s heft I press against to leave constraints of weight below, &amp; heave my thin soul heaven-ward into austerer circlings. Earth’s heft I press against to leave fadeable impressions of my soul stamped here, on flesh, because I know no other place for love. Nature embroiders with debris and graves our bloom with its undoing; entropic floræ of the spring cannot restring the nerves’ route to outpace our saving fears with gentlenesse. Nature embroiders with debris in me, dissonating skin from thought, yet I must hold the loosenings stringently, as in a crystal fugue, to resonate with your arrival. Restring my mind: a web whose song I muffle, hungry, perched at center. Nail our cords from agues to ægis: a green guitar to play the tensions out. Except the grain delves into earth and dies, it is itself—alone; but if it dies it brings forth unimaginable fruit. Nail me through myself and into soil, changed. Selah. Through vague meridians I must come, restrung beyond poles of yes or no until my brittle, wandering will be made into your music, sacrificed. Except in others, I can never sing, so nail me to my enemy; his voice through my own lips articulating Selah. Suited Simple and spiritual intentions slip easily from the memory unless joined to corporeal similitudes. —Jacobus Publicius, Oratoriae artis epitome, 1482 So slip into the patchwork cloak of day again, into this rainbowed cowl: your Sunday best made from the domed refraction of the rain. Put on the miles your trepid feet will pass, laces lagging forever behind them. Ravel the streets, each building’s sequent-chambered sweetnesses; arrange these, room by room, in perfect circuitry: neurons ensconcing a titanic, hybrid heart; its walls dilating—halls, the treble valves &amp; vaults that feed souls’ tissue filtred out unto some deep deific Calm peculiar to these thickets, pastel-clotted avenues impastoed over all the distance fallen. Review. You are a mirror the world has raised up to inspect itself. A turbid vane of weather, ever turning to rejoin its axis, ever seething through until at last the pane can clasp both views together, attenuated in this skein, where all the mottled landscapes vitrify: mind’s fragile cantilever. Into the frayed array, then, into the bottle- neck of stuff &amp; senses, through razor-shoals, through hills &amp; veils, a panoply of puddles, each sky’s emulsion clinging to your shoe soles; never to hold your gaze, its prospects blurring through each others’ edges…you must go, intent on one bright ending in a flurry of endings bright with promise or disaster nearing us now to quench our hurry. So stand in your motions, fastened faster, scuffing through the rut that clocktime blindly leads you roundabout tomorrow into laughter. Incise around your panoramic skull a skyline, plucking the empty vault away: serene extract from traffic’s syllogistic whine. Affix for your jawbone the mercurial sea, silences purling in its deeps—pure words in between the surf’s clamoring teeth. Let such shapes take you as the vivid earth yields, offering your stillest interlude fruit bittersweet as blood or music. Let births recur minutely as your limbs are pruned, or else outgrow your scaffolding until—with rust, mud, blossom, moss—the costumes swallow you. Take as a spine the sunset’s incandescent isthmus, hued by halflight &amp; the sweet debris with which each dusk has touched our tired cheeks &amp; kissed us momentarily before some sidereal switch, flipped, eddies the sky’s exhausted lens to drift &amp; dream myths strewn across the stars, reflected in a ditch. Out of this, GOD authors psalms in periplum: rhymes riven with the fear which limns all ritual, yearning its symmetries unto the farthest hem, unto the squinting filigree of hope &amp; pain, to cull nutrition from the distances. Spreading across light years of dark material, his Soul extends its green attention. Out of the dust swirled burning into personhood, he singes songs where nothing true is lost. Join with all nature, then, in manifolding opacity; its jumbled colors like a kind of night I rifle through, yet have not found a hole in. Now put on clouds of eyes. Put on bright, evaporated beads to magnify the sun’s secrets, dredging up the torrents to arise as sight. Try all of these: take, eat, taste, see. Bliss orders the spheres; its starry pollen glistens, ceilingless. Aside those vasts, seek this one face akin amid its difference, refined by flickers, spectral grasps, &amp; hold me protean, until I shed all distance. Out of me, pull what gleams; the rays unfolding reflections from the waterdark, where sun extends, evoking growth’s blush from the closed, cold deep. Although we do not fit our habitat, as when liquid arcs to lens above a cup’s rim, still, we try. So slip into the great restraints of day again, into the means of meaning, fervent lines I make from studying ecstasy; the bounding, bleary image of your face, my changing child. Let forms phantom through you. Do not fear. I rest beside you while the lullabies unwind, touching my silent mouth to your whorled ear until, hidden in your listening, you find depths drawing up…thrum-thrum…a refrain echoing through ebbed flesh, keeping time, slipping you into the bristly wave of day again… "],

Amid the panoplied cicatrice of branches, splay of angles swim in flame, in spectrum- petalled autumn: somewhere in there, the dirt is firm as death and resurrection, shared marginalia of earth &amp; air, &amp; we are scenery the gorgeous forest stares. Lean down &amp; whisper histories in the upturned ears of flowers. Go in. Tug up the scurf. Lay theorems, accountings, poems there in the hungry nave. Aloft, gold flecks of light revolving float down &amp; up, alight upon pond, unlock &amp; lock as tesserae, leaf’s toothy algorithmic edge, as form which is proportion which is always almost breaking as the great lake: its coruscant facets etched everyhere St. Gregory describes us rising, sleuthing remnant atoms across the universe, the pulse of self still resonant Not atom but PERSON is the fundamental thing. Not space but RELATION. I want to be simple as sand, as years between sands as pattern which is ratio which is word which is wilderness which is sacrifice which is love If the doors of perception were cleansed If the dark matter were swept away If 90% of the body’s cells are not human then what is it that prays in us? then stars would fill the spaceless sky then we would see things as they are. Winter Spring Latesummer With our last polaroids we took pictures of LIGHT and DARKNESS Wild children ranged through the breezy doors Scenes wandered through us unfinished, smudged with cirrus moon hovered over sunred trees Most of matter is empty space. Most of what I know is ignorance. Dear one, you open in flickers. How can I keep you from closing up? from hardening around your guesses? A person doesn’t change except within boundaries as crystals sharpen in the dank dark as wildflowers crowd the trails edge A membrane is prerequisite for LIFE. There has to be an inside and an out. What ratio of fear to reckless love? Strong but not brittle, open not spilling. How do we change without unravelling? Dear one, hold on— a little threadsong to carry you through deep woods We are animals hunting for meanings, wearing the pelts of meanings. Nor is there singing school but studying: tibia, fabula, nebula vastuary All summer I have been reading you stories when I should have been teaching you silence using words made of beach stones —the round tongues of eons All bloom long I should have been learning subtraction. It is natural to lie down. To pack my mouth full. O coax fruit from my lips, O blank O harbinger O time O darling girl I’m gonna hold you in my arms til your feet grow down "],

Ye, edgeless Essence beget the depthless present tense. Excerpted newsreel feeds: Eve errs, etc… Serpent repents. The expected sentence reversed. Hellbent, resplendent, we veer between extremes⇀never rested, we seek new selves. Keened. There there, levees; strewn perplexed where shelter seeps. Where tempest extends, recedes, recedes. Elements render them defenseless: speech freezes, nerves tremble, vessels wreck. Flesh bleeds elements. Speech fetters, verse tethers, yet we seek Thee trenched there, seeded between letters. Ye rest, pretend, engender spheres, bejewel deserts, beget the breeze-sketched trees. Preserve them. We beseech Thee, Nether-Nested: dwell deep here delve green between the temples Be present. Be here. Be dented where we met. Be felt there yet. G Gorged by grace, I gurgle supplications. Give me etcetera. Give me patience. Give me the holy ghosts I have resigned, gathering facts to fill my growling mind. Gaze me naked. Let me become gourmand of groin and gristle. Let my tongue graze daily sweat from love’s gooseflesh; glutted with hunger nonetheless. God, nothing gives me pause; not gulps of cigarette, not shopping malls, not gospel truth, not pain. Grease the clock’s gears, rewind again: grow me a garden where all things recede, my own globed ripeness turning gaunt with want. Gird me with distance, a pen to grave these fevered glyphs on garlic paper, gilt with the pungent gift it guards yet cannot ever grasp. God of the gaps, You peel my meanings back. I K M O Q S U W What do you want with me? Why give me a mind, a welter of wings that beat each other weak with wanderlust? When I was young, I fashioned sprawling walls with Legos. Nostalgia, meanwhile, wrapt me in its bounds. I waited for the losses waiting would create. Why waken those wondrous worlds in me, only to wag Your finger warning: “Watch and wait” while hope wrings wrinkles in my face? What good’s my wondering now? WHERE WHEN WHO HOW WHY WHAT: a compass rose whithering at the window ledge. With my bow and my quiver I aim at You. Words, these words, are a wilderness of want where I am blown toward some vanishing point without ever arriving; where Your heady weather wields me, whittled whole. While thoughts quake my body’s scaffolding, worlds go on—snow thaws, weeds squeeze through, flowers hoist their sweetness up without knowing how. We writhe in one another’s waves; whorled in their turbulence, cleansed. The Question washed within the never of its quest. The Answer widening its wake till waning water cannot bear its trace: wending on, inspired with wind the Question makes. Y ○ “‘…ma tu perche vai?’… ‘per tornar altra volta la dov’io son, fo io questo vïaggio” (Purgatorio 2.90) [“Why are you on this way? So that I may return where I am.”] My soul has leeched into my skin. Raw, haunted. Prayers are like this, a cloud of breath on an icon’s varnish. On a good day, my thoughts rest on the grass like the shadows of grass, blade by blade by blade. I am trying to understand — in the most basic sense: to be beneath, perhaps, or even to be with To run a hand along the branching walls of ancient cities as a way to know that I am To mouth, like wind across doorways, voluble syllables Not to be bewitched by thoughts To handle stones: earth’s braille that scrapes my fingerprints, swallows touch into rough sense In an image blacked by candle smoke, You press one finger to another finger. Some nights the child me would pinch another smaller me, another room, and so on: symbols pressed breathless. The storied worlds have looked their sights away. The only faith I still attempt — Finger pointing to finger. The touch of something touched touching back. Bless. "],
